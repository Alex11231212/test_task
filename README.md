Hi! This is my solution for data scraping high rate smartphones from a marketplace.

How you should use it:
1) install python3.10
2) install requirements from requirements.txt
3) install latest version of Google Chrome
4) run python3 ozon_scraper/start.py module
5) wait about 15 minutes
6) results will appear in ozon_scraper/results.csv
7) enjoy =)
