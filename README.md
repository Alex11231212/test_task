Hi! This is my solution for data scraping high rate smartphones from ozon.ru.

How you should use it:
1) install python3.10
2) install requirements from requirements.txt
3) run python3 ozon_scraper/start.py module
4) wait about 15 minutes
5) results will appear in ozon_scraper/results.csv
6) enjoy =)
